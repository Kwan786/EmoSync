Hello! This is my streamlit group project and I have put a QR code for you to try out the project! This project is named "EmoSync" And It is a chatbot that responsible for providing help support on comforting the user If the user has any mental health issues. The first time when we try to develop this project is because of the number of people suicide because of their mental health issues was not able to be cure or reduce the severe problem. We think that the cost of money to talk with a therapist is expensive to some people so we developed this project to act as a friend of the user to give them a opportunities to talk with a "Friend" to seek for understanding on their problem and likely to listen to them. Our project is free for all to use.
